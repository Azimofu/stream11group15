Project Proposal: The Benefits of the Usage of Communication Software (Discord/Skype/Zoom/etc) during COVID-19 times for Remote Work/Learning/etc


Hunter (2019) states that according to a survey conducted by telecoms group Vodafone in 2016, 75% of companies worldwide employ remote working and of those 83% reported improved productivity.




Benefits of Remote Learning
Eighteen themes were identified based on parental responses to the question about benefits and positive outcomes of remote learning. The most frequently endorsed benefit or positive outcome of remote learning was more family time, endorsed by nearly 20% of parents, followed by more flexibility in the child’s schedule and learning, improved understanding of the child’s learning style and curriculum, lower child stress or anxiety, and an observed increase in the child’s independence and/or confidence. As shown in Figure 3, compared to parents of adolescents, parents of children were less likely to express that flexibility in the child’s schedule and learning was a positive outcome. This is consistent with our finding that these parents were also more likely to report that fostering routine, schedules, organization, and/or time management was the most important strategy to support their child’s learning. Parents of children, compared to parents of adolescents, were also more likely to endorse better understanding of the child’s curriculum and learning needs as a positive outcome. Parents of adolescents more frequently indicated that increased child independence and confidence was a positive outcome, which is consistent with “discovering oneself” being identified by adolescents as one of the primary positive experiences of COVID-19 (Fioretti et al., 2020). Finally, lower child stress and anxiety was endorsed as a positive outcome of remote learning across all groups,though only by 6.3% of parents. It is possible that decreases in stress and anxiety as a result of remote learning may be confounded by increases in stress and anxiety related to the COVID-19 pandemic more generally. Lastly, it is important to note that 12% of families failed to see any positive outcomes or benefits as a result of remote learning, with no group differences.
