Project Proposal: The Benefits of the Usage of Communication Software (Discord/Skype/Zoom/etc) during COVID-19 times for Remote Work/Learning/etc


Hunter (2019) states that according to a survey conducted by telecoms group Vodafone in 2016, 75% of companies worldwide employ remote working and of those 83% reported improved productivity.


**some guideline help for what half the stuff means**
Below is the recommendation from Prof. Tony Clear: 
This may well mean that your topic will need some refining.  
If you begin with an overly broad concept it will be hard to make your arguments concrete.  But if you do choose to stay with a broader conceptual topic, then you may need to demonstrate through concrete cases or examples how risks to society are posed by the technology, [negative aspects as you say], opportunities make available potential developments and [positive aspects] and choices may well relate to our predictions of future outcomes, but also to design choices e.g. cf. the interview with Tim Berners-Lee and the highlighted excerpt below:
https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2021/mar/15/tim-berners-lee-we-need-social-networks-where-bad-things-happen-less 

“But then you should step back. It’s making a good case about how one particular wave of social networks can work, if you train the AI to maximise the engagement of the teenager. But if you train the AI to maximise the happiness of the teenager, or the efficiency of the teenager – well, then the whole thing would produce a very different outcome. You use the same software – you just turn the dial. You could imagine two social networks where most of the code is mostly the same – it’s just that one is optimised for one thing, and the other is optimised for another. And the unintended consequences in each case are completely different.” 
  
I hope this helps but as you can see this can require deep and considered thought.




**needs to be picked apart**

Benefits of Remote Learning
Eighteen themes were identified based on parental responses to the question about benefits and positive outcomes of remote learning. The most frequently endorsed benefit or positive outcome of remote learning was more family time, endorsed by nearly 20% of parents, followed by more flexibility in the child’s schedule and learning, improved understanding of the child’s learning style and curriculum, lower child stress or anxiety, and an observed increase in the child’s independence and/or confidence. As shown in Figure 3, compared to parents of adolescents, parents of children were less likely to express that flexibility in the child’s schedule and learning was a positive outcome. This is consistent with our finding that these parents were also more likely to report that fostering routine, schedules, organization, and/or time management was the most important strategy to support their child’s learning. Parents of children, compared to parents of adolescents, were also more likely to endorse better understanding of the child’s curriculum and learning needs as a positive outcome. Parents of adolescents more frequently indicated that increased child independence and confidence was a positive outcome, which is consistent with “discovering oneself” being identified by adolescents as one of the primary positive experiences of COVID-19 (Fioretti et al., 2020). Finally, lower child stress and anxiety was endorsed as a positive outcome of remote learning across all groups,though only by 6.3% of parents. It is possible that decreases in stress and anxiety as a result of remote learning may be confounded by increases in stress and anxiety related to the COVID-19 pandemic more generally. Lastly, it is important to note that 12% of families failed to see any positive outcomes or benefits as a result of remote learning, with no group differences.
